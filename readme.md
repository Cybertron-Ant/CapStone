List all vegetables and fruits in alphabetic order (name the bottom tab "Fruits and Vegi" and color the tab blue)


Below is the formula that will sort this data alphabetically in an ascending order (A to Z):

=SORT(B2:B43)
 
 
 
 Once you have used this formula, you won’t be able to change any part of the array.
 
 For example, if you want to delete one single cell from the result, you won’t be able to do it. You can delete the entire formula result, but not just one cell value.
