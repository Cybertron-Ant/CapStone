Using filters, create a new worksheet with only the vegetables in alphabetical order (Format the sheet as per above and Name the tab "Vegetables" â€“ color the tab green.)

I can even copy an entire column containing many rows, and paste it in another sheet


Copy the "Type" and the "Produce" columns, place them inside a new sheet called "Vegetables", under columns C and D, respectively. Hide the "Type" and "Produce" columns.

Format Columns A and B with the headers copied from columns C and D

Paste the following formula under column A, in row 2:

=FILTER(C2:D43,C2:C43="V")
