if your data expands and you get new values that you need to be a part of the sum. While you can adjust the formula, there is a better way to make the formula dynamic.

Instead of just using the range that has the values, you include more cells that might get some additional data in the future.


=SUM(C2:C44)

Although cell C44 is empty as of now, it is still used in the formula. In case a value is added to the cell, the formula would automatically update to reflect the new value in the total sum.
